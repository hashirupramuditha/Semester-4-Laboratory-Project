## Portable-GSM-Signal-Jammer

The primary objective is to devise a system capable of generating and transmitting a signal (specifically, a noise signal) within the GSM frequency band. The complete circuit design is rooted in analog circuit implementations, with a focused integration of RF circuit design methodologies in the PCB development process.

Tools & technologies used: NI Multisim, LTSpice, Altium, Solid Works
